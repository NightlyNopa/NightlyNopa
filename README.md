<h2>👋Bazinga!</h2> 

<br>I'm frontend developer(junior) who is looking for a new things to learn, challenges and so on. 

<h3><b>I usually work on</b></h3>

<br>😼 Training design observation on behance
<br>🌛 HTML, CSS
<br>🌱 Sometimes PHP, but wanna only JS now 😆
<br>✨ Working on english 24/7 'cause it's so so

<br>I'm positive, adequate and creative. It seems to me, on the one hand I can be a little bit shy, but on the other hand I like meeting new people with whom we can share new knowledges and discuss it 👀
